BSOP tool can be used during maker events, or at other times, to offer a very easy and consistent way of stimulating highly linked interactions between both similar and complementary types of actors and actions. It allows visitors to indicate whether they are interested in a Maker initiative at the moment they are physically present at the stand or presentation and also what the nature of their interest is (e.g., keep me informed, I have a suggestion, I am prepared to answer questions, I want to invest funds). The enhancement will automatically connect visitors to the appropriate online location or tool/platform (following what the Maker initiative uses and prefers). It can be thought of as a redirection page: First the person interested in the Maker initiative initiates this page, e.g. by scanning a QR code. On the page they see a list of options, based on existing platforms which the Maker initiative makes use of. They can then select their preferred way of participating and are routed to the appropriate online application or platform.
